        Callum, his daughter and along with the
        vampires starts to interrogate Archer. It was
        found that one of the werewolves were
        murdered the same way and on the same as
        Isabelle and the werewolves clan sent Archer
        to investigate the murderer's scent which led
        to the vampire territory.
        Callum was outraged hearing werewolves
        blaming on them and even other vampires
        were in disbelief. It felt like there would be an
        uprising between the vampires instead.
        But Violet was smart enough to understand
        that something was wrong.
        She suggested her father to make a peace
        treaty with the werewolves temporarily
        because both races are chasing after the same
        enemy.So Callum made a temporary peace with
        Trevor, the alpha of the werewolf clan. And
        they start to investigate, After a long
        investigation, they found out that a vampire
        who is a vampire hunter, Daniel has killed Isabelle and the werewolf.
        So when they found Daniel, they were shocked
        hearing his side of story. Daniel was not only a
        vampire but also a werewolf. He is the vampire-
        werewolf hybrid ever existed. Daniel was first a
        werewolf, then he was bitten by a vampire. He
        then became a hybrid and hated himself for
        being an abomination. He developed so much
        hatred that he wanted to destroy both vampire
        and werewolf races. So that is why he killed
        Isabelle and the werewolf to create fight
        between the races and the end to both of the
        races. But he could not believe that vampires
        and the werewolves will be at peace as he saw
        Callum and Trevor.
        Then seeing this, Daniel, could not control
        himself, then he took his life by staking himself
        through his own heart.
        Seeing this, Callum and Trevor realised that to
        exist in this nature, they need to be allies.
        So they made a peace treaty. It's gonna be
        hard, But surely they can at least try, Can't
        they?
